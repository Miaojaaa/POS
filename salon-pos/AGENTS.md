# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Dev environment tips

- Source lives in `salon-pos/`. All `npm` commands below assume you are inside that directory.
- Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + Prisma 7 + SQLite (`prisma/dev.db`) + NextAuth v5 beta. **Do not** assume training-data API shapes — see the `BEGIN:nextjs-agent-rules` block above.
- `npm run dev` boots the dev server. The script uses Windows `set NODE_OPTIONS=…` syntax — on macOS/Linux replace with `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 next dev`.
- `npm run seed` re-seeds the local SQLite via `prisma/seed.ts` (also runs as Prisma's seed hook). The DB lives at `prisma/dev.db` and is git-ignored — never commit it.
- Env: `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` is the only required variable (see `.env.example`). Prisma loads it via `prisma.config.ts` (`import "dotenv/config"`), not Prisma's built-in loader.
- Cross-page settings live in `SystemConfig` (key/value rows) and are exposed at `/api/system-config`. Branding is separate at `/api/branding`. When you save either, dispatch the matching window event so already-open tabs refresh without reload:
  - `system-config-updated` — finance, sidebar, receipt format
  - `branding-updated` — shop name / address / taxId / logo / theme
- Multi-dev settings sync: branding + finance + PINs live in `SystemConfig`, but `prisma/dev.db` is git-ignored — so settings changes don't follow `git push`. Snapshot them via `npm run config:export` (writes `prisma/shared-config.json`, committed) and apply on the other machine via `npm run config:import`. Whitelist of synced keys is in `scripts/export-config.ts` → `SYNCED_KEYS` — update it whenever you add a new shared key. A pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit` → `scripts/check-config-sync.js`, wired up by `npm install`) blocks commits whose `dev.db` has drifted from the snapshot, so forgetting `npm run config:export` is caught before push. See `.agent/skills/shared-config-sync/SKILL.md` for the full workflow, diagnostic checklist, and anti-patterns.
- Save-button convention: snapshot loaded values into a JSON-string state (`initial`), compute `dirty = initial !== "" && JSON.stringify(current) !== initial`, pass `disabled={!dirty}` (plus `saving`). For create-only forms, disable until required fields are filled. The grey-out look is owned by `.btn-primary:disabled` in `globals.css` — **don't** add inline `opacity` / `cursor` styles.
- Payroll: `generatePayrollRun(month, year)` in `src/lib/payroll.ts` deletes-and-recreates the run from scratch, and `GET /api/payroll` regenerates on every request while `status === "DRAFT"`. Changes to `finance.commissionMode` or the formula take effect on the next poll (every 8s on the Payroll page). `CONFIRMED` runs are frozen — only `baseSalary` / `positionAllowance` re-sync from the User table.
- Receipt numbers: always assemble via `buildReceiptNumber(seq, date, cfg)` from `src/lib/system-config.ts`. FULL tax-invoice numbers are snapshotted onto the `Order` row (`taxInvoiceNumber`, `taxInvoiceIssuedAt`, customer fields) on first issuance and must not be regenerated on reprint (Thai tax-law requirement).
- Unit-of-measure trap: chemical volumes are **grams** in code (`unitVolumeG`, `amountG`, `costPerG`) but `@map("unitVolumeMg")` in Prisma. The DB column name is historical; the field name in code is authoritative.

# Testing instructions

- There is no automated test suite. Verify changes by running the affected flow locally with `npm run dev` and exercising the golden path + the obvious edge case (e.g. for payroll, switch `commissionMode` in Finance settings and confirm both Payroll and KPI columns update).
- Type-check with `npx tsc --noEmit`. The validator currently emits one known stale error referencing `src/app/(main)/reports/profit/page.js` from a deleted route — that file no longer exists; deleting `.next/types` clears it. Ignore that single error; treat any other error as a real failure.
- Lint with `npm run lint`. Fix warnings related to files you touched; don't drive-by-fix unrelated noise.
- Build smoke-test with `npm run build` before raising a PR that touches build-critical files (routes, layouts, `next.config.ts`, Prisma schema).
- For schema changes: run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <descriptive>` so a migration is committed, then re-seed if existing data is incompatible. Never edit a migration file after it has been committed and applied.

# PR instructions

- Title format: short, lowercase, imperative — match the existing log style (e.g. `update save button`, `fix commission structure`, `add aesthetic feature`). Avoid bracketed prefixes.
- Keep PRs scoped to one concern. UI tweaks, schema migrations, and seed-data changes should each be their own PR when practical.
- Before opening a PR:
  1. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (modulo the known stale-profit error above)
  2. `npm run lint` clean for files you changed
  3. `npm run build` succeeds if you touched routes / config / schema
  4. Run the feature manually in the browser — screenshots in the PR body for any UI change
- Don't commit: `prisma/dev.db`, `.env`, anything under `.next/`, logos / customer data baked into seed files.
- When you add a new `SystemConfig` key, update the `ALL_KEYS` array in `src/app/api/system-config/route.ts` and the matching default in `src/lib/system-config.ts` in the same PR — otherwise the GET handler returns stale data.
- The default branch is `main`; there is no required base branch or CI gate today, so the author is responsible for the checks above.
